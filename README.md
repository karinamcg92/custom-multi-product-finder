# custom-multi-product-finder
Originally built to act as a shade selector, where **Step 1 - Select Your Skintone Shade** opens 
another area with **Step 2 - Pick Your Undertone**, then a selection of undertones would display where the user can click and it will then list all the products that fit your selection based on the input from above.
